## 💻 Hardware and Environment Requirements
All Experiments were conducted with a machine with machine with
- 252 GB of RAM
- AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5965WX 24-Cores
- Single RTX 3090 GPU for running local LLM with Ollama.
- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS

⚠️ Environment Disclaimer
We recommend using a similar environment to the one described in this project for best results. Specifically:

- A local GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM is suggested for optimal performance.
- The framework can run on machines with lower RAM and CPU specifications than those referenced here, though performance may vary.
- This project is developed and tested on mentioend veresion of Ubuntu Linux. Users on Windows or macOS may need to manually configure Python dependencies and the Ollama environment to ensure compatibility.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions
- Install ```ollama``` from this link: [Ollama Official Website.](https://ollama.com/download/linux) for running the LLM Locally on GPU. 
- Create a new Python Virtual Environment with ```python -m venv path/to/venv```
- Activate the Environment with ```source path/to/venv/bin/activate```
- Run ```python -r requirements.txt``` to install all dependencies in the environment

## 🖥️ Run Instructions
We provide detailed instruction on how to run the framework end-to-end with a hypothetical malware example. LLMalMorph consists of two key stages:

1. **Function Mutator** – Mutates selected functions in a malware source file using LLMs.
2. **Variant Synthesizer** – Iteratively merges mutated functions into the source file, allowing for manual debugging and testing to produce compilable variants. 

### 📁 Output Directory Structure

All outputs are organized within the `output_dir` you specify in the `generate_llm_code_config.cfg` config file. The following subdirectories are especially important:

| Folder                          | Purpose |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| `llm_responses/`               | Contains the LLM-generated function edits (as `.txt` files). You update these manually after debugging. |
| `variant_source_code/sequential/` | Contains the merged source files with up to *n* functions inserted. These files are used for compiling into malware variants. |

> 💡 These folders are inside your configured `cached_dir` (see examples below).

## 🧪 Example Setup (Used Throughout)

For clarity, assume the following:

- You're mutating 5 functions in `file.c` of malware sample named **M**
- Strategy used: `strategy 1`
- LLM model used: `codestral`
- You have access to the **M** malware project with source-code from where you can compile to generate a malware executable.

## 🔧 Stage 1: Function Mutator

This stage mutates a malware source file by generating alternative function implementations using an LLM.

### 🔹 Step 1: Edit the Config File

Edit `LLMalMorph/run_scripts/generate_llm_code_config.cfg` with the following parameters:

```ini
log_dir = directory to save the logs
source_file = path/to/file.c
num_funcs = number of functions to modify
llm = name of the llm to use
output_dir = output directory to save everytyhing
trials = 1  # Keep this as-is
``` 

Example:
```ini
log_dir=../samples/example_samples/M/llm_generated_paper
source_file=../samples/example_samples/M/file.c
num_funcs=5
llm=codestral
output_dir=../samples/example_samples/M/llm_generated_paper
trials=1 
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Run the Script
```bash
bash run_generate_llm_code.sh
```

This generates:

- llm_responses/ with files like *file.c_5_trial_1_batch_1.txt, file.c_5_trial_1_batch_2.txt, ...*

- LLM logs and intermediate files

Once the script finish running, all the llm modifications are in the directory `llm_responses/`. The script automerges the first function. For the example setup, we can find the modified source code in `variant_source_code/sequential/file_5_trial_1_func_1.c` which is directly used with malware *M* to compile the new variant for this function. If it succesfully compiles we move to the next stage. Else we debug and fix the corresponding text file for this function: `llm_responses/file.c_5_trial_1_batch_1.txt`

## 🧪 Stage 2: Variant Synthesizer
This stage merges the mutated functions into the source file one by one and tests whether the malware compiles. Manual debugging is used when needed.

### 🔹 Step 1: Edit Variant Synthesizer Config
Edit ```LLMalMorph/run_scripts/variant_gen_config.cfg```:
```ini
num_functions_merge_back= 2
source_code_file_path= path/to/file.c
cached_dir=directory/to/all/cached/file
``` 

Example:
```ini
num_functions_merge_back=2 # the next function to merge
source_code_file_path=../samples/example_samples/M/file.c
cached_dir=../samples/example_samples/M/llm_generated_paper/strat_1/file/codestral/5_functions
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Run the Variant Generator
```bash
bash run_variant_generator.sh
```

This generates a merged version of file.c with the first n LLM-modified functions placed inside: ```variant_source_code/sequential/```. For the above example we would get:
```ini
variant_source_code/sequential/file_5_trial_1_func_2.c
```

This file would contain llm modified functions 1,and 2. 

## 🔁 Iterative Loop: Merge → Compile → Fix → Repeat
Each iteration for the Stage 2 works as follows:

Try compiling the merged file within the original malware project.

If it compiles ✅ → We have a malware variant for this function!! → Move to the next function.

If it fails ❌:

- Manually debug the merged function(s) in *M* malware project. 

- Locate the LLM response file, e.g.:```llm_responses/file.c_5_trial_1_batch_2.txt```
(Here, batch_2 = 2nd function)

- Paste the fixed function code into the corresponding .txt file.

Update ```num_functions_merge_back = 3``` in the ```variant_gen_config.cfg``` and repeat the process to merge the next function along with previous ones (including the ones that were debugged before). 

Continue this loop until all functions are merged. The function wise debugging and fixing the LLM response ensures the error doesnt propagate through the next steps. Here is a flow showing how the steps work:

>f() 1 → Compile With M project → ✅ → Edit variant_gen_config.cfg → Run Script → Merged f() 1 and 2 in source file → Compile With M project → ❌ → Debug M project and fix the f() 2 → Paste debugged f() 2 in corresponding response .txt file → Edit  variant_gen_config.cfg → Run Script → Merged f() 1, 2(debugged) and 3 in source file → Repeat ... 

> 💡 The amount of bugs that may originate while mutating source code is exhaustive and extremely hard to generalize to create an automated approach. We are working on simplifying the stitching process to have less manual intervention as possible.
